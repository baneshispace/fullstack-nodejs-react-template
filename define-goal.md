### What I Understand You Want to Achieve:

You are looking to build a **Chrome extension** that allows users to interact with **predefined templates** for **ChatGPT** via a **popup interface**. The popup will be part of the Chrome extension and will communicate with your **local full-stack Node.js development server** (which is integrated with **WebSocket**) to trigger predefined actions.

Specifically, the requirements seem to be:
1. **Predefined Templates in Popup**: Users can select from predefined templates in the extension's popup window.
2. **Local Full-Stack Server Integration**:
   - The Chrome extension will communicate with your local backend server (Node.js + Express + MongoDB) via **WebSocket**.
   - The backend server will handle the templates sent from the Chrome extension, likely sending them to ChatGPT or processing them locally.
3. **Vite Plugin for Chrome Extensions** (`crxjs/vite-plugin`):
   - Use **Vite** to build and bundle your Chrome extension, which allows for easy development and fast build times.
   - Integrate the **`crxjs/vite-plugin`** for better handling of Chrome extension-specific features within the Vite environment.
4. **Modern Full-Stack Setup**:
   - You're using **React** with **Vite** on the frontend (for the extension’s popup interface).
   - The backend is built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, and you're using **pnpm** as the package manager.
   - You're also using **TypeScript** for both frontend and backend code.
5. **Development and Production Builds**:
   - You want to leverage Vite's development mode with hot reloading for faster iteration on the Chrome extension.
   - You want to be able to build the Chrome extension for production and load it into Chrome.

### Next Steps & Possible Adjustments:

1. **Review and Acceptance**:
   - Does this align with your goals?
   - Do you need more details on the WebSocket integration or communication between the Chrome extension and your local server?
   - Do you need to extend or modify the predefined templates' interaction with ChatGPT, or is the focus more on the extension’s communication with the local server?

2. **Adjustments**:
   - Are there specific UX/UI features you want to enhance in the popup (e.g., displaying more detailed responses or adding more control over the templates)?
   - Would you like to integrate more automation (e.g., auto-updating the local development server when new templates are added)?
   - Any more advanced features in the extension (e.g., storing user data, communicating with other APIs, or handling more complex WebSocket messages)?
