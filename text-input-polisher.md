# React Component Prompt

## Overview
I need a React component that serves as a popup for a Google Chrome extension. This component should take user input, polish the provided text, perform spell and grammar checks, and suggest enhancement options. The polished text will be fed into a textarea of ChatGPT via its web interface.

## Requirements
1. **Input Field**: A textarea for users to enter their text.
2. **Polish Button**: A button that triggers the polishing process.
3. **Output Field**: A display area where the polished text is shown.
4. **Enhancement Suggestions**: A section that suggests enhancement options for the polished text.

## Features
- **Spell Check**: Automatically check for spelling errors in the input text.
- **Grammar Check**: Identify and correct grammatical mistakes.
- **Enhancement Options**: Provide suggestions for improving clarity, conciseness, and overall text quality.

## Suggested Enhancements
1. **Real-Time Feedback**: Provide instant feedback as the user types.
2. **User Preferences**: Allow users to customize settings for spelling and grammar checks (e.g., American vs. British English).
3. **Integration with ChatGPT**: Directly send the polished text to the ChatGPT textarea for further processing.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure the component is responsive and user-friendly.
- Consider accessibility features for a wider audience reach.
```

### Enhancement Suggestions Breakdown
1. **Real-Time Feedback**: 
   - Implement a debounce function to improve performance and avoid excessive processing on every keystroke.

2. **User Preferences**: 
   - Use a settings modal where users can select their preferred language and toggle options for grammar checks.

3. **Integration with ChatGPT**: 
   - Use the Chrome extension's content script to inject the polished text directly into the ChatGPT textarea, facilitating a seamless user experience.

### Next Steps
- **Design the Component**: Sketch a rough design or wireframe for the component.
- **Set Up the React Project**: Create a new React app or add the component to an existing project.
- **Implement Features**: Start with the input and output fields, followed by the spell and grammar check functionalities.
